Background  
====
The typical visual SLAM methods only provide a map with geometric entities (points, planes, etc.), and there is no saliency information between these entities. Visual saliency or visual attention mechanism refers to mimic the human vision system to select the most salient and interesting features from natural scenes for further processing under different tasks. This is also very important for visual navigation because visual saliency awareness directs the agentâ€™s perceptual attention towards the salient regions containing sufficient visual features in the process of approaching the target.
